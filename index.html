      <p>
         Face mask recognition refers to the ability of computer<br>
         vision systems to detect whether a person is wearing a <br>
         face mask, often as part of broader facial recognition<br>
         or surveillance technologies. This is particularly relevant<br>
         in scenarios like public health monitoring, where wearing<br>
         face masks can be important, such as during a pandemic.
